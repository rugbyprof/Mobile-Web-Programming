## Quiz 2

### Read The Following

- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/

Which links to the following:

- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/
- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-patterns/
- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/navigation-patterns/

### Quiz

There will be a project based, open web, quiz using the concepts learned from the readings.

### Motivation

We will continue to develop our mobile bus app, but take a break tonight (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) 
to actually study the necessary mobile principles needed to achieve our goal. Basically, we have a working 
template but we want to make sure it includes:
- fluid design
- responsive layout
- incorporation of mobile design patterns

In fact, the more I look at https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/ the more I like it. You should look
around the site.
