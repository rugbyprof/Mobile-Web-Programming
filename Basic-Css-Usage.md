## Applying CSS

### Divisions

- Divisions are a block level HTML element used to define sections of an HTML file. 
- A division can contain all the parts that make up your website.
- Including additional divisions, spans, images, text and so on.
- The core element used in layouts.
- You define a division within an HTML file by placing the following between the <body></body> tags:

```html
<div id=”container”>
Site contents go here
</div>
```

-----

### Spans

- Spans are very similar to divisions except they are an inline element versus a block level element. 
- No linebreak is created when a span is declared.
- You can use a span tag to style portions of text, as shown in the following:

```html
<span class=”italic”>This text is italic</span>
```

-----

### Margins
##### Inherited: No

- The margin property declares the margin between an HTML element and the elements around it. 
- The margin property can be set for the top, left, right and bottom of an element. 

```css
  margin-top: length percentage or auto; 
  margin-left: length percentage or auto;
  margin-right: length percentage or auto;
  margin-bottom: length percentage or auto;
```

As you can also see in the above example you have 3 choices of values for the margin property

- length
- percentage
- auto

You can also declare all the margins of an element in a single property as follows:

```css
  margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
```

If you declare all 4 values in a single declaration, they are ordered as follows:

- top
- right
- bottom
- left

If only one value is declared, it sets the margin on all sides:

```css
  margin: 10px;
```

If you only declare two or three values, the undeclared values are taken from the opposing side:

```css
  margin: 10px 10px; /* 2 values */
  margin: 10px 10px 10px; /* 3 values */
```

- You can also set the margin property to negative values. 
- If you do not declare the margin value of an element, the margin is 0 (zero).

```css
  margin: -10px;
```

Elements like paragraphs have default margins in some browsers, to combat this set the margin to 0 (zero).

```css
p {
  margin: 0;
}
```

> You do not have to add px (pixels) or whatever units you use, if the value is 0 (zero).

-----

### Padding
##### Inherited: No

Padding is the distance between the border of an HTML element and the content within it.

- Most of the rules for margins also apply to padding, except there is no “auto” value.
- Negative values cannot be declared for padding.

```css
padding-top: length percentage; 
padding-left: length percentage;
padding-right: length percentage;
padding-bottom: length percentage;
```

As you can also see in the above example you have 2 choices of values for the padding property

- length
- percentage

You can also declare all the padding of an element in a single property as follows:

```css
padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
```

If you declare all 4 values as I have above, the order is as follows:

- top
- right
- bottom
- left

If only one value is declared, it sets the padding on all sides:

```css
padding: 10px;
```

If you only declare two or three values, the undeclared values are taken from the opposing side:

```css
padding: 10px 10px; /* 2 values */
padding: 10px 10px 10px; /* 3 values */
```

> If you do not declare the padding value of an element, the padding is 0 (zero).<br>
You do not have to add px (pixels) or whatever units you use, if the value is 0 (zero).

### Font Properties
##### Inherited: Yes

#### Font
The font property can set the style, weight, variant, size, line height and font:

```css
  font: italic bold normal small/1.4em Verdana, sans-serif;
```

The above would set the text of an element to an italic style a bold weight a normal variant a relative size a line height of 1.4em and the font to Verdana or another sans-serif typeface.


#### Font-Family
You can set what font will be displayed in an element with the font-family property.

There are 2 choices for values:

- family-name
- generic family

If you set a family name it is best to also add the generic family at the end. As this is a priortized list. So if the user does not have the specified font name it will use the same generic family. (see below)

```css
  font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
```

#### Font Size
You can set the size of the text used in an element by using the font-size property.
```css
  font-size: value;
```

There are a lot of choices for values:

| Largest  |         |           |          |         |          |         |           | Smallest | Integer |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| xx-large | x-large | larger    | large    | medium  | small    | smaller | x-small   | xx-small | length  |

#### % (percent)

Percent specifies the portion of the element in ... percentages. Wow. It is trickier than you think.

#### Font Style
You can set the style of text in a element with the font-style property
```css
font-style: value;
```

Possible values are

- normal
- itailc
- oblique

```
  font-variant: value;
```

```css
  font-weight: value;
```

Possible values are

#### Anchors, Links and Pseudo Classes

Below are the various ways you can use CSS to style links.
```css
a:link {color: #009900;}
a:visited {color: #999999;}
a:hover {color: #333333;}
a:focus {color: #333333;}
a:active {color: #009900;}
```

Now lets take a look at what each one of the above link styles actually does.

`a:link {color: #009900;}` The first on the list sets the color of a link when no event is occuring

`a:visited {color: #999999;}` The second sets the color a link changes to, when the user has already visited that url

`a:hover {color: #333333;}` The third sets the color a link changes to as the user places their mouse pointer over the link

`a:focus {color: #333333;}` The fourth is primarilly for the same purpose as the last one, but this one is for users that are not using a mouse and are tabbing through the links via there keyboards tab key, it sets the color a link changes to as the user tabs through the links

`a:active {color: #009900;}` The fifth on the list sets the color a link changes to as it is pressed.

> You must declare the `a:link` and `a:visited` before you declare `a:hover`.<br> Furthermore, you must declare `a:hover` before you can declare `a:active`.

Using the above code will style all links on your web page, unless you declare a seperate set of link styles for a certain area of your webpage.

#### Pseudo Classes

You can set links contained in different parts of your web page to be different colors by using the pseudo class. For example, lets say you want your links in the content area to have a different color then the links in the left or right column of your webpage.

You can do this in the following fashion:
```css
#content a:link {color: #009900;}
#content a:visited {color: #999999;}
#content a:hover {color: #333333;}
#content a:focus {color: #333333;}
#content a:active {color: #009900;}
```

- Now assuming that you have your main content in a division named “content” all links within that division will now be styled by this new style selector. 
- Should your selector have a different name, just change the #content selector to match your division name.

Then for the links in a column you could use the following:
```css
#column a:link {color: #009900;}
#column a:visited {color: #999999;}
#column a:hover {color: #333333;}
#column a:focus {color: #333333;}
#column a:active {color: #009900;}
```

Once again, this assumes the name of the column division, just change the name to match yours.

This same method can be accomplished by declaring a class instead of an id.
```css
a.column:link {color: #009900;}
a.column:visited {color: #999999;}
a.column:hover {color: #333333;}
a.column:focus {color: #333333;}
a.column:active {color: #009900;}
```

Though in this case you will need to add a class to each link
```html
<a class=”column” href=”” title=””>some link text</a>
```
But, there is still yet an easier way
```css
.column a:link {color: #009900;}
.column a:visited {color: #999999;}
.column a:hover {color: #333333;}
.column a:focus {color: #333333;}
.column a:active {color: #009900;}
```
Then in your HTML:
```html
<div class=”column”>
<a href=”” title=””>some link text</a>
</div>
```
