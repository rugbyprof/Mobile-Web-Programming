## Program  2

### Based on Chapter 10 (Device Access)

- https://www.udacity.com/course/cs256 (Mobile Web)
- Which discusses the following:
    - Video
    - Snapshots
    - Gps
    - Accelerometer

We, will be concentrating on just the snapshot feature for this quiz (+ some other stuff).

### The Program Overview

You are going to incorporate Assignment3 (the contact card), along with utilizing the snapshot feature from the Udacity lesson, coupled with some organization features into a single assignment. 

The good news is, I wrote all the necessary camera features into this page: http://msu2u.net/Devices/camera.html, so you can simply find what code is needed, and put it into your contact card code base. The bad news is, it's time to get organized.

### Motivation

This is obviously kind of a quiz / program rolled into one. I have not forgotten about out mobile bus app, but I wanted to re-inforce a couple responsive and organizational web features before we move on. One problem is that just a few of you found it necessary to "organize" your previous assignments by making them all accessible via a single portal (page).

### What needs accomplished:

- Name every file exactly as directed!
- All files will be on your server AND subsequently in github.
- Create a folder on your server called: `Program2` in your `/var/www/html` directory.
- Copy your contact card assignment into a file called `contact.html` and place it into `Program2`
- 
- The changes build from one question to the next, so copy `one.html` to `two.html` and so on.


4. When completed you should have a folder that contains (alphabetically):
- ![1] Program2
    - ![2] index.html
    - ![2] locate_me.html
    - ![2] contact.html
    - ![2] style.css
