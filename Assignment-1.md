##Assignment 1 - Establishing Contact

#### Due: Tuesday Jul 8th by 1300 hrs
<br><br>

We will be using github this semester as a means of communicating, and storing documents (assignments and programs). 	

#### Create a Github account. 
- When you create a Github account, you must choose a `username`. 
- This is very important to remember, because you will email it to me in the next part of this assignment.
- Create a repository named `XXXX-MWSU-Mobile-Web-Programming`, replace the `XXXX` with `4883` or `5443` for undergrad and grad respectively.
- Add me: `rugbyprof` as a collaborator to your repository. You can do this in the settings of your repository.

#### Send me an email:

- `To`: terry.griffin@mwsu.edu
- `Subject`: XXXX Mobile Web - Assignment 1 

>
Hello Professor Griffin,<br><br>
My Name is: place your name here<br>
My Github username is: githubusername

#### Rules for emailing me:

Every email must have a minimum of two items included:

- The course number and title in the subject:
    - `4883 - Mobile Web` or `5443 - Mobile Web`
- Your name

I can't promise an answer if you don't provide those two pieces of information.
