##Assignment 1 - Establishing Contact

#### Due: Tuesday Jul 8th by 1300 hrs
<br><br>

We will be using github this semester as a means of communicating, and storing documents (assignments and programs). 	

#### Create a Github account. 
- When you create a Github account, you must choose a `username`. 
- This is very important to remember, because you will email it to me in the next part of this assignment.
- Create a repository named `XXXX-MWSU-Mobile-Web-Programming`, replace the `XXXX` with `4883` or `5443` for undergrad and grad respectively.
- Add me: `rugbyprof` as a collaborator to your repository. You can do this in the settings of your repository.

#### Send me an email:

- `To`: terry.griffin@mwsu.edu
- `Subject`: Mobile Web - Assignment 1
