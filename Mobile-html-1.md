### Mobile How?

The following examples are a 

### HTML5 doctype

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

### Mobile first

Add this to your `head` tag. More about viewports later.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

This disables zooming on a mobile device. Not recommended, basically use with caution.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
```



#### Fonts

```css
font-family:"Times New Roman",Georgia,Serif;
```
