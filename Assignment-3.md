### Dynamic Contact Card

READ CAREFULLY!!!

#### Starter Code:

Go look at this gist: https://gist.github.com/rugbyprof/720feb08ee65f0f84cb9

It's an exact copy of [Example1c](http://107.170.231.151/Example1c/) that we viewed in class. 

#### Assignment:

Use the form from [Example1c](http://107.170.231.151/Example1c/), with necessary changes, and adapt it to the information on the new contact card we used in [Assignment-1](https://github.com/rugbyprof/Mobile-Web-Programming/blob/master/Assignment-1.md)

#### Specifics:

- Create a folder called `ContactForm`
- Copy your `index.html` from your `/var/www/html` folder into `ContactForm`. If you don't have the correct file, use the faithful wget command and grab it: `wget http://107.170.231.151/index.html`. Run this from your `ContactForm` folder.
- Make necessary changes to the `index.html` page applying the changes that are indicated below on the graphics.
- Specifically:
    - Add your photo
    - Change "Joe Sixpack" to your name
    - Change skill badges to match your skills.
    - Add your email address, a link to your github page, and a link to your server
    - Add a short bio about your self.
